# Preload Warnings - Information

## About These Warnings

The preload warnings you see in the browser console are **browser-level performance warnings**, not JavaScript errors. They indicate that resources were preloaded but not used immediately.

## Why They Appear

1. **Next.js Automatic Preloading**: Next.js automatically preloads CSS and other critical resources for performance
2. **Reown/AppKit Fonts**: The wallet library preloads fonts that may not be used immediately
3. **Development Mode**: These warnings are more common in development mode

## Are They a Problem?

**No, these warnings are:**
- ✅ **Informational only** - They don't break functionality
- ✅ **Development-only** - Usually optimized in production builds
- ✅ **Performance hints** - They're suggestions, not errors
- ✅ **Normal for Next.js apps** - Many Next.js apps show these warnings

## What We've Done

1. ✅ **Optimized font loading** - Using `display: "swap"` for better font loading
2. ✅ **Lazy loaded components** - Components below the fold are lazy loaded
3. ✅ **Optimized scripts** - Bootstrap JS loads with `lazyOnload` strategy
4. ✅ **Image optimizations** - Fixed aspect ratio warnings

## Can We Remove Them?

**Browser preload warnings cannot be suppressed with JavaScript** because they're generated by the browser's Performance API, not JavaScript console.

**Options:**
1. **Accept them** - They're harmless development warnings
2. **Production builds** - Usually optimized away in production
3. **Browser settings** - Some browsers allow disabling performance warnings (not recommended)

## Production Behavior

In production builds:
- Next.js optimizes resource loading
- Unused preloads are minimized
- Warnings are significantly reduced or eliminated

## Summary

These warnings are **normal and expected** in Next.js development mode. They don't affect functionality and are typically resolved in production builds. Focus on actual errors, not these informational warnings.
